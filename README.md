# EnsembleEmbedders

CSCI 2470 Final Project

Make sure to make a python virtual environment

> python -m venv .venv

Activate venv

> source .venv/bin/activate
> this should make your terminal start with (.venv)

Now install dependencies in that venv

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure before running scripts, that you are in the path
EnsembleEmbedders/
not in EnsembleEmbedders/src/
